This directory contains several Scala code examples to learn the SOLID principles applied to statically typed functional programming languages.

The examples and the learnings can be easily transfered to other statically typed functional languages like F#, Miranda etc.

To execute the examples you need a JVM (Java Virtual Machine) and Scala installed on your system.

To run the example just execute the run.sh file in the example directory. To build an example run build.sh. If you are using Windows you have to create a build.cmd and a run.cmd equivalent.
