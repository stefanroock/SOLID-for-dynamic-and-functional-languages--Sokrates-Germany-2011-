This directory contains several Clojure code examples to learn the SOLID principles applied to dynamically typed functional programming languages.

The examples and the learnings can be easily transfered to other dynamically typed functional languages like Lisp, Scheme, etc.

To execute the examples you need a JVM (Java Virtual Machine) installed on your system. The required Clojure jars are provided with the example code.

To run the example just execute the run.sh file in the example directory. If you are using Windows you have to create a run.cmd equivalent.
