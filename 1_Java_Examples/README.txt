This directory contains several Java code examples to learn the SOLID principles applied to statically typed object-oriented programming languages.

The examples and the learnings can be easily transfered to other statically typed object-oriented languages like C++, C#, Objective-C, Eiffel etc.

To execute the examples you need a JVM (Java Virtual Machine) installed on your system.

To run the example just execute the run.sh file in the example directory. To build an example run build.sh. If you are using Windows you have to create a build.cmd and a run.cmd equivalent.
