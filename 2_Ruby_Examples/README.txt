This directory contains several Ruby code examples to learn the SOLID principles applied to duck typed object-oriented programming languages.

The examples and the learnings can be easily transfered to other duck typed object-oriented languages like Smalltalk, Python, etc.

To execute the examples you need Ruby installed on your system.

To run the example just execute the run.sh file in the example directory. If you are using Windows you have to create a run.cmd equivalent.
