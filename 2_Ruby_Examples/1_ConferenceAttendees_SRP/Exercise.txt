We want to introduce Students as discounted participants. They should pay only 20% or the regular price. 

1. What has to be changed in the code to implement the new feature?
2. The existing code violates the SRP (Single Responsibility Principle). Why?
3. What are possible refactorings to make the code conform to the SRP? Is the implementation of the Student feature now easier?
